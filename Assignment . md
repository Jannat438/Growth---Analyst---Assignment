## Part 2: Funnel Debugging via Prompt-Based Diagnosis

### Simulated Funnel Table

| Campaign | Lead → MQL → SQL → Client | Response Rate | Drop-off Reason         | Campaign Message Summary     |
|----------|----------------------------|----------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| A        | ✅ → ✅ → ❌ → ❌             | 20%            | Low trust                | Lacked proof or case study   |
| B        | ✅ → ❌ → ❌ → ❌             | 10%            | Too generic              | Broad messaging              |

## Part 4: Strategic Summary (200 Words)

This assignment made me realize how crucial prompt design is to campaign performance. AI isn’t just a tool to write faster — it’s a way to reflect, debug, and think better. Writing the AIDCA prompts helped me shift from writing “pretty messages” to creating focused, high-signal outreach.

By diagnosing funnel failures, I learned that trust and clarity often break down, not just creativity. And those issues can be solved with smart prompts and strategic thinking. Designing the dashboard helped me step into the founder’s shoes — seeing how systems should serve decision-making.

As a Growth Analyst, I want to be someone who continuously questions, tests, and learns. This exercise has made me excited about data-driven storytelling — and confident that I can use AI with empathy to solve real growth problems.
